Hence, numerical methods are used to find an approximation of the solution. This section of the unit will explain:\n\nThe types of errors that are introduced when turning a differential equation into a format that can be solved on a computer;\nThe theoretical limitations of different numerical methods for solving differential equations;\nHow to develop fast and memory-efficient code for solving differential equations."
